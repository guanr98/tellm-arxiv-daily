|**2024-09-26**|**From News to Forecast: Integrating Event Analysis in LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting with Reflection**|Xinlei Wang et.al.|[2409.17515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17515)|null|This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance time series forecasting using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates various social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations for enriched insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning and reflection to evaluate predictions. This enables our model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By compiling selected news with time series data, we fine-tune the LLaMa2 pre-trained model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and suggest a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting by effectively harnessing unstructured news data.|

The experimental results show that our approach outperforms machine learning-based asset pricing baselines in portfolio optimization and asset pricing errors. Specifically, the Sharpe ratio and average $,\alpha,$ for anomaly portfolios improved significantly by 9.6\% and 10.8\% respectively. In addition, we conducted extensive ablation studies on our model and analysis of the data to reveal further insights into the proposed method.|
|**2024-09-25**|**Turn Every Application into an Agent: Towards Efficient Human-Agent-Computer Interaction with API-First LLM-Based Agents**|Junting Lu et.al.|[2409.17140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17140)|null|Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to directly interact with application user interfaces (UIs), enhancing agents' performance in complex tasks. However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Office Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compare to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and a fresh UI design principle for application providers in the era of LLMs. It also explores the possibility of turning every applications into agents, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).|
|**2024-09-24**|**MultiTalk: Introspective and Extrospective Dialogue for Human-Environment-LLM Alignment**|Venkata Naren Devarakonda et.al.|[2409.16455](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16455)|null|LLMs have shown promising results in task planning due to their strong natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, issues such as hallucinations, ambiguities in human instructions, environmental constraints, and limitations in the executing agent's capabilities often lead to flawed or incomplete plans. This paper proposes MultiTalk, an LLM-based task planning methodology that addresses these issues through a framework of introspective and extrospective dialogue loops. This approach helps ground generated plans in the context of the environment and the agent's capabilities, while also resolving uncertainties and ambiguities in the given task. These loops are enabled by specialized systems designed to extract and predict task-specific states, and flag mismatches or misalignments among the human user, the LLM agent, and the environment. Effective feedback pathways between these systems and the LLM planner foster meaningful dialogue. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated through its application to robotic manipulation tasks. Experiments and ablations highlight the robustness and reliability of our method, and comparisons with baselines further illustrate the superiority of MultiTalk in task planning for embodied agents.|
|**2024-09-23**|**Safe Guard: an LLM-agent for Real-time Voice-based Hate Speech Detection in Social Virtual Reality**|Yiwen Xu et.al.|[2409.15623](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15623)|null|In this paper, we present Safe Guard, an LLM-agent for the detection of hate speech in voice-based interactions in social VR (VRChat). Our system leverages Open AI GPT and audio feature extraction for real-time voice interactions. We contribute a system design and evaluation of the system that demonstrates the capability of our approach in detecting hate speech, and reducing false positives compared to currently available approaches. Our results indicate the potential of LLM-based agents in creating safer virtual environments and set the groundwork for further advancements in LLM-driven moderation approaches.|
|**2024-09-25**|**Towards a Realistic Long-Term Benchmark for Open-Web Research Agents**|Peter MÃ¼hlbacher et.al.|[2409.14913](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14913)|null|We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate agents on real-world "messy" open-web research tasks of the type that are routine in finance and consulting. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.|
|**2024-09-23**|**Interpreting Multi-band Galaxy Observations with Large Language Model-Based Agents**|Zechang Sun et.al.|[2409.14807](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14807)|null|Astronomical research traditionally relies on extensive domain knowledge to interpret observations and narrow down hypotheses. We demonstrate that this process can be emulated using large language model-based agents to accelerate research workflows. We propose mephisto, a multi-agent collaboration framework that mimics human reasoning to interpret multi-band galaxy observations. mephisto interacts with the CIGALE codebase, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) models to explain observations. In this open-world setting, mephisto learns from its self-play experience, performs tree search, and accumulates knowledge in a dynamically updated base. As a proof of concept, we apply mephisto to the latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope. mephisto attains near-human proficiency in reasoning about galaxies' physical scenarios, even when dealing with a recently discovered population of "Little Red Dot" galaxies. This represents the first demonstration of agentic research in astronomy, advancing towards end-to-end research via LLM agents and potentially expediting astronomical discoveries.|
|**2024-09-22**|**Enhancing LLM-based Autonomous Driving Agents to Mitigate Perception Attacks**|Ruoyu Song et.al.|[2409.14488](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14488)|null|There is a growing interest in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, AD systems are vulnerable to attacks against their object detection and tracking (ODT) functions. Unfortunately, our evaluation of four recent LLM agents against ODT attacks shows that the attacks are 63.26% successful in causing them to crash or violate traffic rules due to (1) misleading memory modules that provide past experiences for decision making, (2) limitations of prompts in identifying inconsistencies, and (3) reliance on ground truth perception data.   In this paper, we introduce Hudson, a driving reasoning agent that extends prior LLM-based driving systems to enable safer decision making during perception attacks while maintaining effectiveness under benign conditions. Hudson achieves this by first instrumenting the AD software to collect real-time perception results and contextual information from the driving scene. This data is then formalized into a domain-specific language (DSL). To guide the LLM in detecting and making safe control decisions during ODT attacks, Hudson translates the DSL into natural language, along with a list of custom attack detection instructions. Following query execution, Hudson analyzes the LLM's control decision to understand its causal reasoning process.   We evaluate the effectiveness of Hudson using a proprietary LLM (GPT-4) and two open-source LLMs (Llama and Gemma) in various adversarial driving scenarios. GPT-4, Llama, and Gemma achieve, on average, an attack detection accuracy of 83. 3%, 63. 6%, and 73. 6%. Consequently, they make safe control decisions in 86.4%, 73.9%, and 80% of the attacks. Our results, following the growing interest in integrating LLMs into AD systems, highlight the strengths of LLMs and their potential to detect and mitigate ODT attacks.|
|**2024-09-20**|**Enhancing Fault Localization Through Ordered Code Analysis with LLM Agents and Self-Reflection**|Md Nakhla Rafi et.al.|[2409.13642](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13642)|null|Locating and fixing software faults is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task in software development. Traditional fault localization methods, such as Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL), rely on statistical analysis of test coverage data but often suffer from lower accuracy. Learning-based techniques, while more effective, require extensive training data and can be computationally expensive. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising improvements in fault localization by enhancing code comprehension and reasoning. However, these LLM-based techniques still face challenges, including token limitations, degraded performance with long inputs, and difficulties managing large-scale projects with complex systems involving multiple interacting components. To address these issues, we introduce LLM4FL, a novel LLM-agent-based fault localization approach that integrates SBFL rankings with a divide-and-conquer strategy. By dividing large coverage data into manageable groups and employing multiple LLM agents through prompt chaining, LLM4FL navigates the codebase and localizes faults more effectively. The approach also incorporates self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling agents to iteratively generate fixes and re-rank suspicious methods. We evaluated LLM4FL on the Defects4J (V2.0.0) benchmark, comprising 675 real-world faults from 14 open-source Java projects. Our results demonstrate that LLM4FL outperforms AutoFL by 19.27% in Top-1 accuracy and surpasses state-of-the-art supervised techniques such as DeepFL and Grace, all without task-specific training. Additionally, we highlight the impact of coverage splitting and prompt chaining on fault localization performance and show that different method ordering can improve Top-1 accuracy by up to 22%.|
|**2024-09-23**|**AQA: Adaptive Question Answering in a Society of LLMs via Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit**|Mohanna Hoveyda et.al.|[2409.13447](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13447)|null|In question answering (QA), different questions can be effectively addressed with different answering strategies. Some require a simple lookup, while others need complex, multi-step reasoning to be answered adequately. This observation motivates the development of a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most suitable QA strategy for each question, enabling more efficient and effective systems capable of addressing a broader range of question types. To this aim, we build on recent advances in the orchestration of multiple large language models (LLMs) and formulate adaptive QA as a dynamic orchestration challenge. We define this as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, where the context is defined by the characteristics of the incoming question and the action space consists of potential communication graph configurations among the LLM agents. We then train a linear upper confidence bound model to learn an optimal mapping between different question types and their corresponding optimal multi-LLM communication graph representation. Our experiments show that the proposed solution is viable for adaptive orchestration of a QA system with multiple modules, as it combines the superior performance of more complex strategies while avoiding their costs when simpler strategies suffice.|

In this work, we present EgoLM, a versatile framework that tracks and understands egocentric motions from multi-modal inputs, e.g., egocentric videos and motion sensors. EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale multi-modal human motion dataset validate the effectiveness of EgoLM as a generalist model for universal egocentric learning.|

User interface icons are essential for navigation and interaction and often lack meaningful alt-text, creating barriers to effective use. Traditional deep learning approaches for generating alt-text require extensive datasets and struggle with the diversity and imbalance of icon types. More recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) require complete UI screens, which can be impractical during the iterative phases of app development. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate informative alt-text for mobile UI icons with partial UI data. By incorporating icon context, that include class, resource ID, bounds, OCR-detected text, and contextual information from parent and sibling nodes, we fine-tune an off-the-shelf LLM on a small dataset of approximately 1.4k icons, yielding IconDesc. In an empirical evaluation and a user study IconDesc demonstrates significant improvements in generating relevant alt-text. This ability makes IconDesc an invaluable tool for developers, aiding in the rapid iteration and enhancement of UI accessibility.|

DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations. Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding. Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement. We make code and benchmarks publicly available.|

Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.|

To address this issue, a new paradigm named Online Long-context Processing (OLP) is proposed when we process a document of unlimited length, which typically occurs in the information reception and organization of diverse streaming media such as automated news reporting, live e-commerce, and viral short videos. Moreover, a dilemma was often encountered when we tried to select the most suitable LLM from a large number of LLMs amidst explosive growth aiming for outstanding performance, affordable prices, and short response delays. In view of this, we also develop Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline according to their actual performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on our OLP-MINI dataset and it is found that OLP with Role-RL framework achieves OLP benchmark with an average recall rate of 93.2% and the LLM cost saved by 79.4%. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Role-RL.|

However, these evaluations have mainly focused on English text and involved a single target sentence within lengthy contexts. Our work investigates how LLM performance generalizes to multilingual settings with multiple hidden target sentences. We comprehensively evaluate several long-context LLMs on retrieval and reasoning tasks across five languages: English, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Swahili, and Somali. These languages share the Latin script but belong to distinct language families and resource levels. Our analysis reveals a significant performance gap between languages. The best-performing models such as Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4o, achieve around 96% accuracy in English to around 36% in Somali with a single target sentence. However, this accuracy drops to 40% in English and 0% in Somali when dealing with three target sentences. Our findings highlight the challenges long-context LLMs face when processing longer contexts, an increase in the number of target sentences, or languages of lower resource levels.|

Integrating sustainability into TRS has become essential with the increasing need to balance environmental impact, local community interests, and visitor satisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing TRS for sustainable city trips using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We enhance the traditional RAG system by incorporating a sustainability metric based on a city's popularity and seasonal demand during the prompt augmentation phase. This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR), ensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals. Evaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently matches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS.|

We fine-tune Temporal Adapters for Llama 3 8B on full timelines from a panel of British Twitter users, and extract longitudinal aggregates of emotions and attitudes with established questionnaires. We validate our estimates against representative British survey data and find strong positive, significant correlations for several collective emotions. The obtained estimates are robust across multiple training seeds and prompt formulations, and in line with collective emotions extracted using a traditional classification model trained on labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend the analysis of affect in LLMs to a longitudinal setting through Temporal Adapters. Our work enables new approaches towards the longitudinal analysis of social media data.**|

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) show remarkable effectiveness in processing multimodal information. In this study, we introduce an LLM-based approach for reconstructing visual-semantic information from fMRI signals elicited by video stimuli. Specifically, we employ fine-tuning techniques on an fMRI encoder equipped with adaptors to transform brain responses into latent representations aligned with the video stimuli. Subsequently, these representations are mapped to textual modality by LLM. In particular, we integrate self-supervised domain adaptation methods to enhance the alignment between visual-semantic information and brain responses. Our proposed method achieves good results using various quantitative semantic metrics, while yielding similarity with ground-truth information.|

However, they still encounter difficulties in solving mathematical problems due to the rigorous and logical nature of mathematics. Previous studies have employed techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), prompt engineering, and search-based methods to improve the mathematical problem-solving abilities of LLMs. Despite these efforts, their performance remains suboptimal and demands substantial computational resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, BEATS, to enhance mathematical problem-solving abilities. Our method leverages newly designed prompts that guide the model to iteratively rewrite, advance by one step, and generate answers based on previous steps. Additionally, we introduce a new back-verification technique that uses LLMs to validate the correctness of the generated answers. Furthermore, we employ a pruning tree search to optimize search time while achieving strong performance. Notably, our method improves Qwen2-7b-Instruct's score from 36.94 to 61.52, outperforming GPT4's 42.5 on the MATH benchmark.|

|**2024-09-26**|**Enhancing Tourism Recommender Systems for Sustainable City Trips Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation**|Ashmi Banerjee et.al.|[2409.18003](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18003)|null|Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) have traditionally focused on providing personalized travel suggestions, often prioritizing user preferences without considering broader sustainability goals. Integrating sustainability into TRS has become essential with the increasing need to balance environmental impact, local community interests, and visitor satisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing TRS for sustainable city trips using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We enhance the traditional RAG system by incorporating a sustainability metric based on a city's popularity and seasonal demand during the prompt augmentation phase. This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR), ensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals. Evaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently matches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS.|
|**2024-09-26**|**Efficient In-Domain Question Answering for Resource-Constrained Environments**|Isaac Chung et.al.|[2409.17648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17648)|null|Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a common method for integrating external knowledge into pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance accuracy and relevancy in question answering (QA) tasks. However, prompt engineering and resource efficiency remain significant bottlenecks in developing optimal and robust RAG solutions for real-world QA applications. Recent studies have shown success in using fine tuning to address these problems; in particular, Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) applied to smaller 7B models has demonstrated superior performance compared to RAG setups with much larger models such as GPT-3.5. The combination of RAFT with parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), promises an even more efficient solution, yet remains an unexplored area. In this work, we combine RAFT with LoRA to reduce fine tuning and storage requirements and gain faster inference times while maintaining comparable RAG performance. This results in a more compute-efficient RAFT, or CRAFT, which is particularly useful for knowledge-intensive QA tasks in resource-constrained environments where internet access may be restricted and hardware resources limited.|
|**2024-09-26**|**Enhancing Structured-Data Retrieval with GraphRAG: Soccer Data Case Study**|Zahra Sepasdar et.al.|[2409.17580](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17580)|null|Extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information. Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries. Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information. This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation. Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times. While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured domains.|

To address this issue, we developed LLaMa-SciQ, an educational chatbot designed to assist college students in solving and understanding MCQs in STEM fields. We begin by fine-tuning and aligning the models to human preferences. After comparing the performance of Mistral-7B and LLaMa-8B, we selected the latter as the base model due to its higher evaluation accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and apply quantization to compress the model, reducing inference time and increasing accessibility for students. For mathematical reasoning, LLaMa-SciQ achieved 74.5% accuracy on the GSM8k dataset and 30% on the MATH dataset. However, RAG does not improve performance and even reduces it, likely due to retriever issues or the model's unfamiliarity with context. Despite this, the quantized model shows only a 5% loss in performance, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements.|
|**2024-09-25**|**Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models for Novelty Assessment in Scholarly Publications**|Ethan Lin et.al.|[2409.16605](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16605)|null|Recent studies have evaluated the creativity/novelty of large language models (LLMs) primarily from a semantic perspective, using benchmarks from cognitive science. However, accessing the novelty in scholarly publications is a largely unexplored area in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a scholarly novelty benchmark (SchNovel) to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess novelty in scholarly papers. SchNovel consists of 15000 pairs of papers across six fields sampled from the arXiv dataset with publication dates spanning 2 to 10 years apart. In each pair, the more recently published paper is assumed to be more novel. Additionally, we propose RAG-Novelty, which simulates the review process taken by human reviewers by leveraging the retrieval of similar papers to assess novelty. Extensive experiments provide insights into the capabilities of different LLMs to assess novelty and demonstrate that RAG-Novelty outperforms recent baseline models.|

However, the inherent heterogeneity of these teams presents significant challenges in initial task allocation (ITA), which involves assigning the most suitable tasks to each team member based on their individual capabilities before task execution. While current learning-based methods have shown promising results, they are often computationally expensive to train, and lack the flexibility to incorporate user preferences in multi-objective optimization and adapt to last-minute changes in real-world dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose REBEL, an LLM-based ITA framework that integrates rule-based and experience-enhanced learning. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation, REBEL dynamically retrieves relevant rules and past experiences, enhancing reasoning efficiency. Additionally, REBEL can complement pre-trained RL-based ITA policies, improving situational awareness and overall team performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across various settings. More details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/ita-rebel .|
|**2024-09-24**|**Cyber Knowledge Completion Using Large Language Models**|Braden K Webb et.al.|[2409.16176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16176)|null|The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has expanded their cyber-attack surface, introducing new and sophisticated threats with potential to exploit emerging vulnerabilities. Assessing the risks of CPSs is increasingly difficult due to incomplete and outdated cybersecurity knowledge. This highlights the urgent need for better-informed risk assessments and mitigation strategies. While previous efforts have relied on rule-based natural language processing (NLP) tools to map vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a unique opportunity to enhance cyber-attack knowledge completion through improved reasoning, inference, and summarization capabilities. We apply embedding models to encapsulate information on attack patterns and adversarial techniques, generating mappings between them using vector embeddings. Additionally, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approach that leverages pre-trained models to create structured mappings between different taxonomies of threat patterns. Further, we use a small hand-labeled dataset to compare the proposed RAG-based approach to a baseline standard binary classification model. Thus, the proposed approach provides a comprehensive framework to address the challenge of cyber-attack knowledge graph completion.|
|**2024-09-24**|**Controlling Risk of Retrieval-augmented Generation: A Counterfactual Prompting Framework**|Lu Chen et.al.|[2409.16146](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16146)|null|Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to mitigate the hallucination issues of large language models. However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications. In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence. Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments. For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.|
|**2024-09-24**|**SwiftDossier: Tailored Automatic Dossier for Drug Discovery with LLMs and Agents**|Gabriele Fossi et.al.|[2409.15817](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15817)|null|The advancement of artificial intelligence algorithms has expanded their application to several fields such as the biomedical domain. Artificial intelligence systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs), can be particularly advantageous in drug discovery, which is a very long and expensive process. However, LLMs by themselves lack in-depth knowledge about specific domains and can generate factually incorrect information. Moreover, they are not able to perform more complex actions that imply the usage of external tools. Our work is focused on these two issues. Firstly, we show how the implementation of an advanced RAG system can help the LLM to generate more accurate answers to drug-discovery-related questions. The results show that the answers generated by the LLM with the RAG system surpass in quality the answers produced by the model without RAG. Secondly, we show how to create an automatic target dossier using LLMs and incorporating them with external tools that they can use to execute more intricate tasks to gather data such as accessing databases and executing code. The result is a production-ready target dossier containing the acquired information summarized into a PDF and a PowerPoint presentation.|

Access to immediate medical care is limited, particularly in developing countries, necessitating automated support systems. Large Language Models like ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Gemini have advanced natural language processing in general and question answering in particular, however, they are prone to producing factually incorrect responses (i.e. hallucinations). Retrieval-augmented generation systems, integrating curated documents, can improve large language models' performance and reduce the incidence of hallucination. We introduce AsthmaBot, a multi-lingual, multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation system for asthma support. Evaluation of an asthma-related frequently asked questions dataset shows AsthmaBot's efficacy. AsthmaBot has an added interactive and intuitive interface that integrates different data modalities (text, images, videos) to make it accessible to the larger public. AsthmaBot is available online via \url{asthmabot.datanets.org}.|

|**2024-08-27**|**Text2SQL is Not Enough: Unifying AI and Databases with TAG**|Asim Biswal et.al.|[2408.14717](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14717)|**[link](https://github.com/tag-research/tag-bench)**|**AI systems that serve natural language questions over databases promise to unlock tremendous value. Such systems would allow users to leverage the powerful reasoning and knowledge capabilities of language models (LMs) alongside the scalable computational power of data management systems. These combined capabilities would empower users to ask arbitrary natural language questions over custom data sources. However, existing methods and benchmarks insufficiently explore this setting. Text2SQL methods focus solely on natural language questions that can be expressed in relational algebra, representing a small subset of the questions real users wish to ask. Likewise, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) considers the limited subset of queries that can be answered with point lookups to one or a few data records within the database. We propose Table-Augmented Generation (TAG), a unified and general-purpose paradigm for answering natural language questions over databases. The TAG model represents a wide range of interactions between the LM and database that have been previously unexplored and creates exciting research opportunities for leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LMs over data. We systematically develop benchmarks to study the TAG problem and find that standard methods answer no more than 20% of queries correctly, confirming the need for further research in this area. We release code for the benchmark at https://github.com/TAG-Research/TAG-Bench.**|

This study introduces SageCopilot, an advanced, industry-grade system system that automates the data science pipeline by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Autonomous Agents (AutoAgents), and Language User Interfaces (LUIs). Specifically, SageCopilot incorporates a two-phase design: an online component refining users' inputs into executable scripts through In-Context Learning (ICL) and running the scripts for results reporting & visualization, and an offline preparing demonstrations requested by ICL in the online phase. A list of trending strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and prompt-tuning have been used to augment SageCopilot for enhanced performance. Through rigorous testing and comparative analysis against prompt-based solutions, SageCopilot has been empirically validated to achieve superior end-to-end performance in generating or executing scripts and offering results with visualization, backed by real-world datasets. Our in-depth ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of various components and strategies used by SageCopilot to the end-to-end correctness for data sciences.|

While prior works often adapted off-the-shelf encoders to retrieve examples dynamically, an inherent discrepancy exists in the representational capacities between the external retrievers and the LLMs. Further, optimizing the selection of examples is a non-trivial task, since there are no straightforward methods to assess the relative benefits of examples without performing pairwise inference. To address these shortcomings, we propose DeTriever, a novel demonstration retrieval framework that learns a weighted combination of LLM hidden states, where rich semantic information is encoded. To train the model, we propose a proxy score that estimates the relative benefits of examples based on the similarities between output queries. Experiments on two popular NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on one-shot NL2SQL tasks.|

The emergence of Large Language Models has introduced a novel paradigm in NL2SQL tasks, enhancing capabilities dramatically. However, this raises a critical question: Are we fully prepared to deploy NL2SQL models in production?   To address the posed questions, we present a multi-angle NL2SQL evaluation framework, NL2SQL360, to facilitate the design and test of new NL2SQL methods for researchers. Through NL2SQL360, we conduct a detailed comparison of leading NL2SQL methods across a range of application scenarios, such as different data domains and SQL characteristics, offering valuable insights for selecting the most appropriate NL2SQL methods for specific needs. Moreover, we explore the NL2SQL design space, leveraging NL2SQL360 to automate the identification of an optimal NL2SQL solution tailored to user-specific needs. Specifically, NL2SQL360 identifies an effective NL2SQL method, SuperSQL, distinguished under the Spdier dataset using the execution accuracy metric. Remarkably, SuperSQL achieves competitive performance with execution accuracy of 87% and 62.66% on the Spider and BIRD test sets, respectively.**|

Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task. First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode. In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations. The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult. ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns. The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM. Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.|

LLMs trained by extensive corpora have strong natural language understanding and basic SQL generation abilities without additional tuning specific to NL2SQL tasks. Existing LLMs-based NL2SQL approaches try to improve the translation by enhancing the LLMs with an emphasis on user intention understanding. However, LLMs sometimes fail to generate appropriate SQL due to their lack of knowledge in organizing complex logical operator composition. A promising method is to input the LLMs with demonstrations, which include known NL2SQL translations from various databases. LLMs can learn to organize operator compositions from the input demonstrations for the given task. In this paper, we propose PURPLE (Pre-trained models Utilized to Retrieve Prompts for Logical Enhancement), which improves accuracy by retrieving demonstrations containing the requisite logical operator composition for the NL2SQL task on hand, thereby guiding LLMs to produce better SQL translation. PURPLE achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 80.5% exact-set match accuracy and 87.8% execution match accuracy on the validation set of the popular NL2SQL benchmark Spider. PURPLE maintains high accuracy across diverse benchmarks, budgetary constraints, and various LLMs, showing robustness and cost-effectiveness.|

However, assessing structural similarity based solely on the natural language expressions of queries, without considering SQL queries, presents a significant challenge. This paper explores the significance of this similarity metric and proposes a model for accurately estimating it. To achieve this, we leverage a dataset comprising 170k question pairs, meticulously curated to train a similarity prediction model. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model adeptly captures the structural similarity between questions, as evidenced by improvements in Kendall-Tau distance and precision@k metrics. Notably, our model outperforms strong competitive embedding models from OpenAI and Cohere. Furthermore, compared to these competitive models, our proposed encoder enhances the downstream performance of NL2SQL models in 1-shot in-context learning scenarios by 1-2\% for GPT-3.5-turbo, 4-8\% for CodeLlama-7B, and 2-3\% for CodeLlama-13B.|

Nevertheless, they face challenges when dealing with verbose database information and complex user intentions. This paper presents a two-stage framework to enhance the performance of current LLM-based natural language to SQL systems. We first introduce a novel prompt representation, called reference-enhanced representation, which includes schema information and randomly sampled cell values from tables to instruct LLMs in generating SQL queries. Then, in the first stage, question-SQL pairs are retrieved as few-shot demonstrations, prompting the LLM to generate a preliminary SQL (PreSQL). After that, the mentioned entities in PreSQL are parsed to conduct schema linking, which can significantly compact the useful information. In the second stage, with the linked schema, we simplify the prompt's schema information and instruct the LLM to produce the final SQL. Finally, as the post-refinement module, we propose using cross-consistency across different LLMs rather than self-consistency within a particular LLM. Our methods achieve new SOTA results on the Spider benchmark, with an execution accuracy of 87.6%.**|

Yet, the translation of Natural Language (NL) into the Graph Query Language (GQL), referred to as NL2GQL, poses significant challenges owing to its intricate and specialized nature. Some approaches have sought to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to address analogous tasks like text2SQL. Nonetheless, in the realm of NL2GQL tasks tailored to a particular domain, the absence of domain-specific NL-GQL data pairs adds complexity to aligning LLMs with the graph DB. To tackle this challenge, we present a well-defined pipeline. Initially, we utilize ChatGPT to generate NL-GQL data pairs, leveraging the provided graph DB with self-instruction. Subsequently, we employ the generated data to fine-tune LLMs, ensuring alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. Moreover, we find the importance of relevant schema in efficiently generating accurate GQLs. Thus, we introduce a method to extract relevant schema as the input context. We evaluate our method using two carefully constructed datasets derived from graph DBs in the finance and medicine domains, named FinGQL and MediGQL. Experimental results reveal that our approach significantly outperforms a set of baseline methods, with improvements of 5.90 and 6.36 absolute points on EM, and 6.00 and 7.09 absolute points on EX for FinGQL and MediGQL, respectively.|

Applying FL, clients train machine learning models on a local dataset and a central server aggregates the learned parameters coming from the clients, training a global machine learning model without sharing user's data. However, the state-of-the-art shows several approaches to promote attacks on FL systems. For instance, inverting or leaking gradient attacks can find, with high precision, the local dataset used during the training phase of the FL. This paper presents an approach, called Deep Leakage from Gradients with Feedback Blending (DLG-FB), which is able to improve the inverting gradient attack, considering the spatial correlation that typically exists in batches of images. The performed evaluation shows an improvement of 19.18% and 48,82% in terms of attack success rate and the number of iterations per attacked image, respectively.|

Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) extends the FL paradigm by eliminating the central server, thereby enhancing scalability and robustness through the avoidance of a single point of failure. However, DFL faces significant challenges in optimizing security, as most Byzantine-robust algorithms proposed in the literature are designed for centralized scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation algorithm to enhance the security of Decentralized Federated Learning environments, coined WFAgg. This proposal handles the adverse conditions and strength robustness of dynamic decentralized topologies at the same time by employing multiple filters to identify and mitigate Byzantine attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maintaining model accuracy and convergence in the presence of various Byzantine attack scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art centralized Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes (such as Multi-Krum or Clustering). These algorithms are evaluated on an IID image classification problem in both centralized and decentralized scenarios.|

Many heterogeneity issues in this process are raised by non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. This study focuses on the issue of label distribution skew. To address it, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework called HFLDD, which integrates dataset distillation to generate approximately independent and equally distributed (IID) data, thereby improving the performance of model training. Particularly, we partition the clients into heterogeneous clusters, where the data labels among different clients within a cluster are unbalanced while the data labels among different clusters are balanced. The cluster headers collect distilled data from the corresponding cluster members, and conduct model training in collaboration with the server. This training process is like traditional federated learning on IID data, and hence effectively alleviates the impact of Non-IID data on model training. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method with typical baseline methods on public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that when the data labels are severely imbalanced, the proposed HFLDD outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both test accuracy and communication cost.|

We conduct an asymptotic analysis of Unified Distributed SGD (UD-SGD), exploring a variety of communication patterns, including decentralized SGD and local SGD within Federated Learning (FL), as well as the increasing communication interval in the FL setting. In this study, we assess how different sampling strategies, such as i.i.d. sampling, shuffling, and Markovian sampling, affect the convergence speed of UD-SGD by considering the impact of agent dynamics on the limiting covariance matrix as described in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Our findings not only support existing theories on linear speedup and asymptotic network independence, but also theoretically and empirically show how efficient sampling strategies employed by individual agents contribute to overall convergence in UD-SGD. Simulations reveal that a few agents using highly efficient sampling can achieve or surpass the performance of the majority employing moderately improved strategies, providing new insights beyond traditional analyses focusing on the worst-performing agent.|

Most prior work either overlooks the potential non-stationarity in the dynamics of client unavailability or requires substantial memory/computation overhead. We study federated learning in the presence of heterogeneous and non-stationary client availability, which may occur when the deployment environments are uncertain or the clients are mobile. The impacts of the heterogeneity and non-stationarity in client unavailability can be significant, as we illustrate using FedAvg, the most widely adopted federated learning algorithm. We propose FedAPM, which includes novel algorithmic structures that (i) compensate for missed computations due to unavailability with only $O(1)$ additional memory and computation with respect to standard FedAvg, and (ii) evenly diffuse local updates within the federated learning system through implicit gossiping, despite being agnostic to non-stationary dynamics. We show that FedAPM converges to a stationary point of even non-convex objectives while achieving the desired linear speedup property. We corroborate our analysis with numerical experiments over diversified client unavailability dynamics on real-world data sets.|

Semi-decentralized FL (SD-FL) has proposed a solution for device-to-device (D2D) enabled networks that divides model cooperation into two stages: at the lower stage, D2D communications is employed for local model aggregations within subnetworks (subnets), while the upper stage handles device-server (DS) communications for global model aggregations. However, existing SD-FL schemes are based on gradient diversity assumptions that become performance bottlenecks as data distributions become more heterogeneous. In this work, we develop semi-decentralized gradient tracking (SD-GT), the first SD-FL methodology that removes the need for such assumptions by incorporating tracking terms into device updates for each communication layer. Our analytical characterization of SD-GT reveals upper bounds on convergence for non-convex, convex, and strongly-convex problems. We show how the bounds enable the development of an optimization algorithm that navigates the performance-efficiency trade-off by tuning subnet sampling rate and D2D rounds for each global training interval. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that SD-GT obtains substantial improvements in trained model quality and communication cost relative to baselines in SD-FL and gradient tracking on several datasets.|
|**2024-09-25**|**Immersion and Invariance-based Coding for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning**|Haleh Hayati et.al.|[2409.17201](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17201)|null|Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a method to preserve privacy in collaborative distributed learning. In FL, clients train AI models directly on their devices rather than sharing data with a centralized server, which can pose privacy risks. However, it has been shown that despite FL's partial protection of local data privacy, information about clients' data can still be inferred from shared model updates during training. In recent years, several privacy-preserving approaches have been developed to mitigate this privacy leakage in FL, though they often provide privacy at the cost of model performance or system efficiency. Balancing these trade-offs presents a significant challenge in implementing FL schemes. In this manuscript, we introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that combines differential privacy and system immersion tools from control theory. The core idea is to treat the optimization algorithms used in standard FL schemes (e.g., gradient-based algorithms) as a dynamical system that we seek to immerse into a higher-dimensional system (referred to as the target optimization algorithm). The target algorithm's dynamics are designed such that, first, the model parameters of the original algorithm are immersed in its parameters; second, it operates on distorted parameters; and third, it converges to an encoded version of the true model parameters from the original algorithm. These encoded parameters can then be decoded at the server to retrieve the original model parameters. We demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving scheme can be tailored to offer any desired level of differential privacy for both local and global model parameters, while maintaining the same accuracy and convergence rate as standard FL algorithms.|

The proposed algorithm incorporates gradient tracking and heavy-ball momentum to distributively optimize a global objective function, while preserving local data privacy. Under DSGTm-TV, agents will update local model parameters and gradient estimates using information exchange with neighboring agents enabled through row- and column-stochastic mixing matrices, which we show guarantee both consensus and optimality. Our analysis establishes that DSGTm-TV exhibits linear convergence to the exact global optimum when exact gradient information is available, and converges in expectation to a neighborhood of the global optimum when employing stochastic gradients. Moreover, in contrast to existing methods, DSGTm-TV preserves convergence for networks with uncoordinated stepsizes and momentum parameters, for which we provide explicit bounds. These results enable agents to operate in a fully decentralized manner, independently optimizing their local hyper-parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach via comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines on real-world image classification and natural language processing tasks.|
|**2024-09-24**|**Flight: A FaaS-Based Framework for Complex and Hierarchical Federated Learning**|Nathaniel Hudson et.al.|[2409.16495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16495)|null|Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm where models are trained on distributed devices and are aggregated at a central server. Existing FL frameworks assume simple two-tier network topologies where end devices are directly connected to the aggregation server. While this is a practical mental model, it does not exploit the inherent topology of real-world distributed systems like the Internet-of-Things. We present Flight, a novel FL framework that supports complex hierarchical multi-tier topologies, asynchronous aggregation, and decouples the control plane from the data plane. We compare the performance of Flight against Flower, a state-of-the-art FL framework. Our results show that Flight scales beyond Flower, supporting up to 2048 simultaneous devices, and reduces FL makespan across several models. Finally, we show that Flight's hierarchical FL model can reduce communication overheads by more than 60%.|

A significant challenge in FL is the communication bottleneck in the upload direction, and thus the corresponding energy consumption of the devices, attributed to the increasing size of the model/gradient. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a zero-order (ZO) optimization method that requires the upload of a quantized single scalar per iteration by each device instead of the whole gradient vector. We prove its theoretical convergence and find an upper bound on its convergence rate in the non-convex setting, and we discuss its implementation in practical scenarios. Our FL method and the corresponding convergence analysis take into account the impact of quantization and packet dropping due to wireless errors. We show also the superiority of our method, in terms of communication overhead and energy consumption, as compared to standard gradient-based FL methods.|

|**2024-09-24**|**Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts**|Xiaoming Shi et.al.|[2409.16040](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040)|**[link](https://github.com/time-moe/time-moe)**|**Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.**|
|**2024-09-24**|**Boosting Code-Switching ASR with Mixture of Experts Enhanced Speech-Conditioned LLM**|Fengrun Zhang et.al.|[2409.15905](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15905)|null|In this paper, we introduce a speech-conditioned Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based connector to address the challenge of Code-Switching (CS) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Specifically, we propose an Insertion and Deletion of Interruption Token (IDIT) mechanism for better transfer text generation ability of LLM to speech recognition task. We also present a connecter with MoE architecture that manages multiple languages efficiently. To further enhance the collaboration of multiple experts and leverage the understanding capabilities of LLM, we propose a two-stage progressive training strategy: 1) The connector is unfrozen and trained with language-specialized experts to map speech representations to the text space. 2) The connector and LLM LoRA adaptor are trained with the proposed IDIT mechanism and all experts are activated to learn general representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including end-to-end and large-scale audio-language models.|
|**2024-09-24**|**Toward Mixture-of-Experts Enabled Trustworthy Semantic Communication for 6G Networks**|Jiayi He et.al.|[2409.15695](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15695)|null|Semantic Communication (SemCom) plays a pivotal role in 6G networks, offering a viable solution for future efficient communication. Deep Learning (DL)-based semantic codecs further enhance this efficiency. However, the vulnerability of DL models to security threats, such as adversarial attacks, poses significant challenges for practical applications of SemCom systems. These vulnerabilities enable attackers to tamper with messages and eavesdrop on private information, especially in wireless communication scenarios. Although existing defenses attempt to address specific threats, they often fail to simultaneously handle multiple heterogeneous attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based SemCom system. This system comprises a gating network and multiple experts, each specializing in different security challenges. The gating network adaptively selects suitable experts to counter heterogeneous attacks based on user-defined security requirements. Multiple experts collaborate to accomplish semantic communication tasks while meeting the security requirements of users. A case study in vehicular networks demonstrates the efficacy of the MoE-based SemCom system. Simulation results show that the proposed MoE-based SemCom system effectively mitigates concurrent heterogeneous attacks, with minimal impact on downstream task accuracy.|

We propose GRKAN as an alternative to the traditional gating function, aiming to enhance efficiency and interpretability in MoE modeling. Through extensive experiments on digital asset markets and real estate valuation, we demonstrate that KAMoE consistently outperforms traditional MoE architectures across various tasks and model types. Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.**|
|**2024-09-23**|**Multi-Modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLM, Diffusion and Beyond**|Hong Chen et.al.|[2409.14993](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14993)|null|Multi-modal generative AI has received increasing attention in both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques are: i) The multi-modal large language model (MLLM) such as GPT-4V, which shows impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; ii) The diffusion model such as Sora, which exhibits remarkable multi-modal powers, especially with respect to visual generation. As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a unified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question, in this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion models, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language models as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two important questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should adopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether the model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE) architectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives. We further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and analyze their potential advantages and disadvantages. We also summarize existing large-scale multi-modal datasets for better model pretraining in the future. To conclude the paper, we present several challenging future directions, which we believe can contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.|
|**2024-09-20**|**On-device Collaborative Language Modeling via a Mixture of Generalists and Specialists**|Dongyang Fan et.al.|[2409.13931](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13931)|null|We target on-device collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by adapting a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts are Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. In conventional MoE approaches, experts develop into specialists throughout training. In contrast, we propose a novel $\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning approach via a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$ pecialists (CoMiGS). Diversifying into the two roles is achieved by aggregating certain experts globally while keeping others localized to specialize in user-specific datasets. Central to our work is a learnable routing network that routes at a token level, balancing collaboration and personalization at the finest granularity. Our method consistently demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with high data heterogeneity across various datasets. By design, our approach accommodates varying computational resource constraints among users as shown in different numbers of LoRA experts. We further showcase that low-resourced users can benefit from high-resourced users with high data quantity.|
|**2024-09-18**|**Mixture of Diverse Size Experts**|Manxi Sun et.al.|[2409.12210](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12210)|null|The Sparsely-Activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity for scaling up large language models (LLMs) without exploding computational costs. Despite its success, the current design faces a challenge where all experts have the same size, limiting the ability of tokens to choose the experts with the most appropriate size for generating the next token. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Diverse Size Experts (MoDSE), a new MoE architecture with layers designed to have experts of different sizes. Our analysis of difficult token generation tasks shows that experts of various sizes achieve better predictions, and the routing path of the experts tends to be stable after a training period. However, having experts of diverse sizes can lead to uneven workload distribution. To tackle this limitation, we introduce an expert-pair allocation strategy to evenly distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoDSE, as it outperforms existing MoEs by allocating the parameter budget to experts adaptively while maintaining the same total parameter size and the number of experts.|
|**2024-09-18**|**GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE**|Liyuan Liu et.al.|[2409.12136](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136)|null|Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN (GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping. Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2 16 $\times$ 3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters, outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy, achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.|
|**2024-09-17**|**LPT++: Efficient Training on Mixture of Long-tailed Experts**|Bowen Dong et.al.|[2409.11323](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11323)|null|We introduce LPT++, a comprehensive framework for long-tailed classification that combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with a learnable model ensemble. LPT++ enhances frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) through the integration of three core components. The first is a universal long-tailed adaptation module, which aggregates long-tailed prompts and visual adapters to adapt the pretrained model to the target domain, meanwhile improving its discriminative ability. The second is the mixture of long-tailed experts framework with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) scorer, which adaptively calculates reweighting coefficients for confidence scores from both visual-only and visual-language (VL) model experts to generate more accurate predictions. Finally, LPT++ employs a three-phase training framework, wherein each critical module is learned separately, resulting in a stable and effective long-tailed classification training paradigm. Besides, we also propose the simple version of LPT++ namely LPT, which only integrates visual-only pretrained ViT and long-tailed prompts to formulate a single model method. LPT can clearly illustrate how long-tailed prompts works meanwhile achieving comparable performance without VL pretrained models. Experiments show that, with only ~1% extra trainable parameters, LPT++ achieves comparable accuracy against all the counterparts.|
|**2024-09-10**|**DA-MoE: Towards Dynamic Expert Allocation for Mixture-of-Experts Models**|Maryam Akhavan Aghdam et.al.|[2409.06669](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06669)|null|Transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have been driving several recent technological advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). These MoE models adopt a router mechanism to determine which experts to activate for routing input tokens. However, existing router mechanisms allocate a fixed number of experts to each token, which neglects the varying importance of different input tokens. In this study, we propose a novel dynamic router mechanism that Dynamically Allocates a variable number of experts for Mixture-of-Experts (DA-MoE) models based on an effective token importance measure. First, we show that the Transformer attention mechanism provides a natural and effective way of calculating token importance. Second, we propose a dynamic router mechanism that effectively decides the optimal number of experts (K) and allocates the top-K experts for each input token. Third, comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DA-MoE approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer based MoE model on the popular GLUE benchmark.|
