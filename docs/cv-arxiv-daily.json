The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community.

Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and achieves text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree from a tool agent. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k, which is built upon 1000 cleaned real patient cases by cooperating with a pioneering psychiatric hospital, and contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labelled Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset.

The emergence of social norms fosters coordination among agents without any hard-coded rules, which is crucial for the large-scale deployment of AVs in an intelligent transportation system. This paper explores the application of LLMs in understanding and modeling social norms in autonomous driving games. We introduce LLMs into autonomous driving games as intelligent agents who make decisions according to text prompts. These agents are referred to as LLM-based agents. Our framework involves LLM-based agents playing Markov games in a multi-agent system (MAS), allowing us to investigate the emergence of social norms among individual agents. We aim to identify social norms by designing prompts and utilizing LLMs on textual information related to the environment setup and the observations of LLM-based agents. Using the OpenAI Chat API powered by GPT-4.0, we conduct experiments to simulate interactions and evaluate the performance of LLM-based agents in two driving scenarios: unsignalized intersection and highway platoon. The results show that LLM-based agents can handle dynamically changing environments in Markov games, and social norms evolve among LLM-based agents in both scenarios. In the intersection game, LLM-based agents tend to adopt a conservative driving policy when facing a potential car crash. The advantage of LLM-based agents in games lies in their strong operability and analyzability, which facilitate experimental design.|\n", "2408.14307": "|**2024-08-26**|**LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing**|Yayati Jadhav et.al.|[2408.14307](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14307)|null|Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.|\n", "2408.14033": "|**2024-08-26**|**MLR-Copilot: Autonomous Machine Learning Research based on Large Language Models Agents**|Ruochen Li et.al.|[2408.14033](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14033)|**[link](https://github.com/du-nlp-lab/mlr-copilot)**|**Machine learning research, crucial for technological advancements and innovation, often faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity, slow pace of experimentation, and the necessity for specialized expertise.

Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding modules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution.

However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench (Kiela et al., 2021) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multistep human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires much human labor, often at prohibitive cost. In this work, we propose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models. In the last stage, human experts investigate the challenging examples, manually design templates, and identify the types of failures the taskspecific models consistently exhibit. We apply SYNTHEVAL to two classification tasks, sentiment analysis and toxic language detection, and show that our framework is effective in identifying weaknesses of strong models on these tasks.

Serialized output training (SOT) is a classic method to address multi-talker ASR, with the idea of concatenating transcriptions from multiple speakers according to the emission times of their speech for training. However, SOT-style transcriptions, derived from concatenating multiple related utterances in a conversation, depend significantly on modeling long contexts. Therefore, compared to traditional methods that primarily emphasize encoder performance in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architectures, a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained decoders may be better suited for such complex and challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based SOT approach for multi-talker ASR, leveraging pre-trained speech encoder and LLM, fine-tuning them on multi-talker dataset using appropriate strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional AED-based methods on the simulated dataset LibriMix and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation set of the real-world dataset AMI, outperforming the AED model trained with 1000 times more supervised data in previous works.|\n", "2408.17404": "|**2024-08-30**|**Getting Inspiration for Feature Elicitation: App Store- vs. LLM-based Approach**|Jialiang Wei et.al.|[2408.17404](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17404)|null|Over the past decade, app store (AppStore)-inspired requirements elicitation has proven to be highly beneficial.

With the advance of Generative AI, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of large language model (LLM)-inspired requirements elicitation. LLMs can assist in this process by providing inspiration for new feature ideas. While both approaches are gaining popularity in practice, there is a lack of insight into their differences. We report on a comparative study between AppStore- and LLM-based approaches for refining features into sub-features. By manually analyzing 1,200 sub-features recommended from both approaches, we identified their benefits, challenges, and key differences. While both approaches recommend highly relevant sub-features with clear descriptions, LLMs seem more powerful particularly concerning novel unseen app scopes.

However, the existing NTP paradigm contains several limitations, particularly related to planned task complications and error propagation during inference. In our work, we extend the critique of NTP, highlighting its limitation also due to training with a narrow objective: the prediction of a sub-optimal one-hot distribution. To support this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output distribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By evaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot distribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more closely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we introduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$-gram distributions to replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online training time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task, language transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can achieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average improvement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the medical domain. This demonstrates the concrete benefits of addressing the target narrowing problem, pointing to a new direction for future work on improving NTP.|\n", "2408.17362": "|**2024-08-30**|**Assessing Generative Language Models in Classification Tasks: Performance and Self-Evaluation Capabilities in the Environmental and Climate Change Domain**|Francesca Grasso et.al.|[2408.17362](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17362)|**[link](https://github.com/stefanolocci/LLMClassification)**|**This paper examines the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3.5 and Llama2 and one Small Language Model (SLM) Gemma, across three different classification tasks within the climate change (CC) and environmental domain.

However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF.

The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation.

It is not intuitive for LLMs to command causality, since pretrained models usually work on statistical associations, and do not focus on causes and effects in sentences. So that probing internal manipulation of causality is necessary for LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to probe causality manipulation hierarchically, by providing different shortcuts to models and observe behaviors. We exploit retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models on a designed causality classification task. We conduct experiments on mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models. Our results suggest that LLMs can detect entities related to causality and recognize direct causal relationships. However, LLMs lack specialized cognition for causality, merely treating them as part of the global semantic of the sentence.**|\n", "2408.14317": "|**2024-08-26**|**Claim Verification in the Age of Large Language Models: A Survey**|Alphaeus Dmonte et.al.|[2408.14317](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14317)|null|\n", "2408.13833": "|**2024-08-25**|**Biomedical Large Languages Models Seem not to be Superior to Generalist Models on Unseen Medical Data**|Felix J.

To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer Co-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.|\n", "2408.15171": "|**2024-08-27**|**Measuring text summarization factuality using atomic facts entailment metrics in the context of retrieval augmented generation**|N.

However, a major challenge for enterprise and commercial adoption of LLMs is their tendency to generate inaccurate information, a phenomenon known as \"hallucination.\" This project proposes a method for estimating the factuality of a summary generated by LLMs when compared to a source text.

This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information (\"margins\") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning.

Previous work has proposed various hard negative mining strategies, but these strategies are typically employed as preprocessing steps. In this paper, we propose the conan-embedding model, which maximizes the utilization of more and higher-quality negative examples. Specifically, since the model's ability to handle preprocessed negative examples evolves during training, we propose dynamic hard negative mining method to expose the model to more challenging negative examples throughout the training process. Secondly, contrastive learning requires as many negative examples as possible but is limited by GPU memory constraints. Therefore, we use a Cross-GPU balancing Loss to provide more negative examples for embedding training and balance the batch size across multiple tasks.

Currently, effective approaches leverage feature-level rather than token-level autoregression within the draft model to facilitate more straightforward predictions and enhanced knowledge distillation. In this paper, we reassess these approaches and propose FSPAD (Feature Sampling and Partial Alignment Distillation for Lossless Speculative Decoding), which introduces two straightforward and effective components within the existing framework to boost lossless speculative decoding. Firstly, FSPAD utilizes token embeddings to sample features of the target LLM in high-dimensional space before feeding them into the draft model, due to the inherent uncertainty of the features preventing the draft model from obtaining the specific token output by the target LLM. Secondly, FSPAD introduces partial alignment distillation to weaken the draft model's connection between features and logits, aiming to reduce the conflict between feature alignment and logit confidence during training. Our experiments include both greedy and non-greedy decoding on the largest and smallest models from the Vicuna and LLaMA3-Instruct series, as well as tasks in multi-turn conversation, translation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation.

However, they also have a massive number of parameters, resulting in enormous model sizes, thus making them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constraint devices. Block-wise generation can be a promising alternative for designing compact-sized (parameter-efficient) deep generative models since the model can generate one block at a time instead of generating the whole image at once. However, block-wise generation is also considerably challenging because ensuring coherence across generated blocks can be non-trivial. To this end, we design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach and leverage the corresponding blocks of the images retrieved by the RAG module to condition the training and generation stages of a block-wise denoising diffusion model.

However, traditional context-based rewriting has minimal enhancement on downstream generation tasks due to the lengthy process from query rewriting to response generation. Some researchers try to utilize reinforcement learning with generation feedback to assist the rewriter, but these sparse rewards provide little guidance in most cases, leading to unstable training and generation results. We find that user's needs are also reflected in the gold document, retrieved documents and ground truth. Therefore, by feeding back these multi-aspect dense rewards to query rewriting, more stable and satisfactory responses can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a novel query rewriting method MaFeRw, which improves RAG performance by integrating multi-aspect feedback from both the retrieval process and generated results. Specifically, we first use manual data to train a T5 model for the rewriter initialization. Next, we design three metrics as reinforcement learning feedback: the similarity between the rewritten query and the gold document, the ranking metrics, and ROUGE between the generation and the ground truth. Inspired by RLAIF, we train three kinds of reward models for the above metrics to achieve more efficient training. Finally, we combine the scores of these reward models as feedback, and use PPO algorithm to explore the optimal query rewriting strategy. Experimental results on two conversational RAG datasets demonstrate that MaFeRw achieves superior generation metrics and more stable training compared to baselines.|\n"}, "text2sql": {"2408.07702": "|**2024-08-14**|**The Death of Schema Linking?

First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode. In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.

Communication-Efficient Federated Learning**|Zichen Tang et.al.|[2408.14736](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14736)|null|Current data compression methods, such as sparsification in Federated Averaging (FedAvg), effectively enhance the communication efficiency of Federated Learning (FL). However, these methods encounter challenges such as the straggler problem and diminished model performance due to heterogeneous bandwidth and non-IID (Independently and Identically Distributed) data. To address these issues, we introduce a bandwidth-aware compression framework for FL, aimed at improving communication efficiency while mitigating the problems associated with non-IID data. First, our strategy dynamically adjusts compression ratios according to bandwidth, enabling clients to upload their models at a close pace, thus exploiting the otherwise wasted time to transmit more data. Second, we identify the non-overlapped pattern of retained parameters after compression, which results in diminished client update signals due to uniformly averaged weights. Based on this finding, we propose a parameter mask to adjust the client-averaging coefficients at the parameter level, thereby more closely approximating the original updates, and improving the training convergence under heterogeneous environments. Our evaluations reveal that our method significantly boosts model accuracy, with a maximum improvement of 13% over the uncompressed FedAvg. Moreover, it achieves a $3.37\\times$ speedup in reaching the target accuracy compared to FedAvg with a Top-K compressor, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence with compression. The integration of common compression techniques into our framework further establishes its potential as a versatile foundation for future cross-device, communication-efficient FL research, addressing critical challenges in FL and advancing the field of distributed machine learning.|\n", "2408.14735": "|**2024-08-27**|**PPVF: An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Online Video Fetching Framework with Correlated Differential Privacy**|Xianzhi Zhang et.al.|[2408.14735](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14735)|null|Online video streaming has evolved into an integral component of the contemporary Internet landscape. Yet, the disclosure of user requests presents formidable privacy challenges. As users stream their preferred online videos, their requests are automatically seized by video content providers, potentially leaking users' privacy.   Unfortunately, current protection methods are not well-suited to preserving user request privacy from content providers while maintaining high-quality online video services. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Privacy-Preserving Video Fetching (PPVF) framework, which utilizes trusted edge devices to pre-fetch and cache videos, ensuring the privacy of users' requests while optimizing the efficiency of edge caching. More specifically, we design PPVF with three core components: (1) \\textit{Online privacy budget scheduler}, which employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select non-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative videos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to consider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \\textit{Noisy video request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition to original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate request privacy. (3) \\textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages federated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online fashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world video request traces from Tencent Video. The results demonstrate that PPVF effectively safeguards user request privacy while upholding high video caching performance.|\n", "2408.14689": "|**2024-08-26**|**Federated User Preference Modeling for Privacy-Preserving Cross-Domain Recommendation**|Li Wang et.al.|[2408.14689](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14689)|**[link](https://github.com/lili1013/fupm)**|**Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the data-sparsity problem by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing CDR methods generally assume that the user-item interaction data is shareable between domains, which leads to privacy leakage. Recently, some privacy-preserving CDR (PPCDR) models have been proposed to solve this problem. However, they primarily transfer simple representations learned only from user-item interaction histories, overlooking other useful side information, leading to inaccurate user preferences. Additionally, they transfer differentially private user-item interaction matrices or embeddings across domains to protect privacy. However, these methods offer limited privacy protection, as attackers may exploit external information to infer the original data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated User Preference Modeling (FUPM) framework. In FUPM, first, a novel comprehensive preference exploration module is proposed to learn users' comprehensive preferences from both interaction data and additional data including review texts and potentially positive items. Next, a private preference transfer module is designed to first learn differentially private local and global prototypes, and then privately transfer the global prototypes using a federated learning strategy. These prototypes are generalized representations of user groups, making it difficult for attackers to infer individual information. Extensive experiments on four CDR tasks conducted on the Amazon and Douban datasets validate the superiority of FUPM over SOTA baselines.

It is particularly prevalent in audiovisual learning, with audio is often assumed to be the weaker modality in recognition tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce ModalityMirror to improve audio model performance by leveraging knowledge distillation from an audiovisual federated learning model. ModalityMirror involves two phases: a modality-wise FL stage to aggregate uni-modal encoders; and a federated knowledge distillation stage on multi-modality clients to train an unimodal student model. Our results demonstrate that ModalityMirror significantly improves the audio classification compared to the state-of-the-art FL methods such as Harmony, particularly in audiovisual FL facing video missing. Our approach unlocks the potential for exploiting the diverse modality spectrum inherent in multi-modal FL.|\n", "2408.15621": "|**2024-08-28**|**Convergent Differential Privacy Analysis for General Federated Learning: the f-DP Perspective**|Yan Sun et.al.|[2408.15621](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15621)|null|Federated learning (FL) is an efficient collaborative training paradigm extensively developed with a focus on local privacy protection, and differential privacy (DP) is a classical approach to capture and ensure the reliability of local privacy. The powerful cooperation of FL and DP provides a promising learning framework for large-scale private clients, juggling both privacy securing and trustworthy learning. As the predominant algorithm of DP, the noisy perturbation has been widely studied and incorporated into various federated algorithms, theoretically proven to offer significant privacy protections. However, existing analyses in noisy FL-DP mostly rely on the composition theorem and cannot tightly quantify the privacy leakage challenges, which is nearly tight for small numbers of communication rounds but yields an arbitrarily loose and divergent bound under the large communication rounds. This implies a counterintuitive judgment, suggesting that FL may not provide adequate privacy protection during long-term training. To further investigate the convergent privacy and reliability of the FL-DP framework, in this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the worst privacy of two classical methods under the non-convex and smooth objectives based on the f-DP analysis, i.e. Noisy-FedAvg and Noisy-FedProx methods. With the aid of the shifted-interpolation technique, we successfully prove that the worst privacy of the Noisy-FedAvg method achieves a tight convergent lower bound. Moreover, in the Noisy-FedProx method, with the regularization of the proxy term, the worst privacy has a stable constant lower bound. Our analysis further provides a solid theoretical foundation for the reliability of privacy protection in FL-DP. Meanwhile, our conclusions can also be losslessly converted to other classical DP analytical frameworks, e.g. $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP and R$\\acute{\\text{e}}$nyi-DP (RDP).|\n", "2408.15600": "|**2024-08-28**|**Exploring Selective Layer Fine-Tuning in Federated Learning**|Yuchang Sun et.al.|[2408.15600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15600)|null|Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for fine-tuning foundation models using distributed data in a privacy-preserving manner. Under limited computational resources, clients often find it more practical to fine-tune a selected subset of layers, rather than the entire model, based on their task-specific data. In this study, we provide a thorough theoretical exploration of selective layer fine-tuning in FL, emphasizing a flexible approach that allows the clients to adjust their selected layers according to their local data and resources. We theoretically demonstrate that the layer selection strategy has a significant impact on model convergence in two critical aspects: the importance of selected layers and the heterogeneous choices across clients. Drawing from these insights, we further propose a strategic layer selection method that utilizes local gradients and regulates layer selections across clients. The extensive experiments on both image and text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy compared with several baselines, highlighting its advances in identifying critical layers that adapt to the client heterogeneity and training dynamics in FL.|\n", "2408.15591": "|**2024-08-29**|**VFLIP: A Backdoor Defense for Vertical Federated Learning via Identification and Purification**|Yungi Cho et.al.|[2408.15591](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15591)|**[link](https://github.com/blingcho/vflip-esorics24)**|**Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) focuses on handling vertically partitioned data over FL participants.

In this paper, we present the first backdoor defense, called VFLIP, specialized for VFL. VFLIP employs the identification and purification techniques that operate at the inference stage, consequently improving the robustness against backdoor attacks to a great extent. VFLIP first identifies backdoor-triggered embeddings by adopting a participant-wise anomaly detection approach. Subsequently, VFLIP conducts purification which removes the embeddings identified as malicious and reconstructs all the embeddings based on the remaining embeddings.

A contrasting approach is automated scaling analogous to tuning-free step-size schemes in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, which offer competitive convergence rates and exhibit good empirical performance. In this work, we introduce two algorithms for automated scaling of global model updates. In our first algorithm, we establish that a descent-ensuring step-size regime at the clients ensures descent for the server objective. We show that such a scheme enables linear convergence for strongly convex federated objectives. Our second algorithm shows that the average of objective values of sampled clients is a practical and effective substitute for the objective function value at the server required for computing the scaling factor, whose computation is otherwise not permitted. Our extensive empirical results show that the proposed methods perform at par or better than the popular federated learning algorithms for both convex and non-convex problems.

While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Specifically, heterogeneous data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We introduce a novel approach, FissionVAE, which decomposes the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we investigate the incorporation of hierarchical VAE architectures and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within our model. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decomposition process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images of Earth.
