However, their agents mostly follow predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that remain unchanged across the whole interaction, lacking autonomy and scalability. Additionally, current solutions often overlook the necessity for effective agent cooperation. To address the above limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a practical framework designed for autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM Agent systems. MegaAgent leverages the autonomy of agents to dynamically generate agents based on task requirements, incorporating features such as automatically dividing tasks, systematic planning and monitoring of agent activities, and managing concurrent operations. In addition, MegaAgent is designed with a hierarchical structure and employs system-level parallelism to enhance performance and boost communication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MegaAgent through Gobang game development, showing that it outperforms popular LLM-MA systems; and national policy simulation, demonstrating its high autonomy and potential to rapidly scale up to 590 agents while ensuring effective cooperation among them. Our results indicate that MegaAgent is the first autonomous large-scale LLM-MA system with no pre-defined SOPs, high effectiveness and scalability, paving the way for further research in this field.

These autonomous agents can understand high-level instructions, interact with their environments, and execute complex tasks using a selection of tools available to them. As the capabilities of the agents expand, ensuring their safety and trustworthiness becomes more imperative. In this study, we introduce the Athena framework which leverages the concept of verbal contrastive learning where past safe and unsafe trajectories are used as in-context (contrastive) examples to guide the agent towards safety while fulfilling a given task. The framework also incorporates a critiquing mechanism to guide the agent to prevent risky actions at every step. Furthermore, due to the lack of existing benchmarks on the safety reasoning ability of LLM-based agents, we curate a set of 80 toolkits across 8 categories with 180 scenarios to provide a safety evaluation benchmark.

This work introduces RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning ability of LLMs in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents interact with the environment to gather observations and discern patterns, using these insights to solve problems. To further enhance the rule-learning capabilities of LLM agents within this benchmark, we propose IDEA agent, which integrates Induction, Deduction, and Abduction processes. IDEA agent refines this approach by leveraging a structured reasoning sequence: generating hypotheses through abduction, testing them via deduction, and refining them based on feedback from induction. This sequence enables agents to dynamically establish and apply rules, mimicking human-like reasoning processes. Our evaluation of five representative LLMs indicates that while these models can generate plausible initial hypotheses, they often struggle with strategic interaction within the environment, effective incorporation of feedback, and adaptive refinement of their hypotheses. IDEA agent demonstrates significantly improved performance on the RULEARN benchmark, offering valuable insights for the development of agents capable of human-like rule-learning in real-world scenarios.

The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymous patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and achieves text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree from a tool agent. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k, which is built upon 1000 cleaned real patient cases by cooperating with a pioneering psychiatric hospital, and contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results as labels.

The emergence of social norms fosters coordination among agents without any hard-coded rules, which is crucial for the large-scale deployment of AVs in an intelligent transportation system. This paper explores the application of LLMs in understanding and modeling social norms in autonomous driving games. We introduce LLMs into autonomous driving games as intelligent agents who make decisions according to text prompts. These agents are referred to as LLM-based agents. Our framework involves LLM-based agents playing Markov games in a multi-agent system (MAS), allowing us to investigate the emergence of social norms among individual agents. We aim to identify social norms by designing prompts and utilizing LLMs on textual information related to the environment setup and the observations of LLM-based agents. Using the OpenAI Chat API powered by GPT-4.0, we conduct experiments to simulate interactions and evaluate the performance of LLM-based agents in two driving scenarios: unsignalized intersection and highway platoon. The results show that LLM-based agents can handle dynamically changing environments in Markov games, and social norms evolve among LLM-based agents in both scenarios. In the intersection game, LLM-based agents tend to adopt a conservative driving policy when facing a potential car crash. The advantage of LLM-based agents in games lies in their strong operability and analyzability, which facilitate experimental design.|\n", "2408.14307": "|**2024-08-26**|**LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing**|Yayati Jadhav et.al.|[2408.14307](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14307)|null|Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.|\n", "2408.14033": "|**2024-08-26**|**MLR-Copilot: Autonomous Machine Learning Research based on Large Language Models Agents**|Ruochen Li et.al.|[2408.14033](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14033)|**[link](https://github.com/du-nlp-lab/mlr-copilot)**|**Machine learning research, crucial for technological advancements and innovation, often faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity, slow pace of experimentation, and the necessity for specialized expertise.

Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide.

Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

A class of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate these computational challenges by selectively fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters. Although computationally efficient, these techniques often fail to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models, primarily due to inherent biases introduced during parameter selection. Traditional selective PEFT techniques use a fixed set of parameters based on a predefined budget (a process also known as unmasking), failing to capture parameter importance dynamically and often ending up exceeding the budget. We introduce $\\text{ID}^3$, a novel selective PEFT method that calculates parameter importance continually and dynamically unmasks parameters by balancing exploration and exploitation in parameter selection. Our empirical study on 15 tasks spanning natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method compared to fixed-masking-based PEFT techniques. We analytically show that $\\text{ID}^3$ reduces the number of gradient updates by a factor of two, enhancing computational efficiency. $\\text{ID}^3$ is robust to random initialization of neurons and, therefore, can be seamlessly integrated into existing additive and reparametrization-based PEFT modules such as adapters and LoRA for dynamic sparsification.**|\n", "2408.14467": "|**2024-08-26**|**Explicit Inductive Inference using Large Language Models**|Tianyang Liu et.al.|[2408.14467](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14467)|null|Large Language Models (LLMs) are reported to hold undesirable attestation bias on inference tasks: when asked to predict if a premise P entails a hypothesis H, instead of considering H's conditional truthfulness entailed by P, LLMs tend to use the out-of-context truth label of H as a fragile proxy. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that exploits this bias to do explicit inductive inference. Our pipeline uses an LLM to transform a premise into a set of attested alternatives, and then aggregate answers of the derived new entailment inquiries to support the original inference prediction. On a directional predicate entailment benchmark, we demonstrate that by applying this simple pipeline, we can improve the overall performance of LLMs on inference and substantially alleviate the impact of their attestation bias.|\n", "2408.14418": "|**2024-08-26**|**MEDSAGE: Enhancing Robustness of Medical Dialogue Summarization to ASR Errors with LLM-generated Synthetic Dialogues**|Kuluhan Binici et.al.|[2408.14418](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14418)|null|Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are pivotal in transcribing speech into text, yet the errors they introduce can significantly degrade the performance of downstream tasks like summarization. This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical dialogue summarization, a low-resource domain where supervised data for fine-tuning is scarce, necessitating the use of ASR models as black-box solutions. Employing conventional data augmentation for enhancing the noise robustness of summarization models is not feasible either due to the unavailability of sufficient medical dialogue audio recordings and corresponding ASR transcripts. To address this challenge, we propose MEDSAGE, an approach for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation using Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we leverage the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on a few available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. Experimental results show that LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, and incorporating this noisy data into the training process significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems. This approach addresses the challenges of noisy ASR outputs in critical applications, offering a robust solution to enhance the reliability of clinical dialogue summarization.|\n", "2408.14398": "|**2024-08-26**|**Language-specific Calibration for Pruning Multilingual Language Models**|Simon Kurz et.al.|[2408.14398](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14398)|null|Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pruning have shown state-of-the-art compression results in post-training and retraining-free settings while maintaining high predictive performance. However, such research mainly considers calibrating pruning using English text, despite the multilingual nature of modern LLMs and their frequent uses in non-English languages. In this paper, we set out to explore effective strategies for calibrating the pruning of multilingual language models. We present the first comprehensive empirical study, comparing different calibration languages for pruning multilingual models across diverse tasks, models, and state-of-the-art pruning techniques. Our results present practical suggestions, for example, calibrating in the target language can efficiently yield lower perplexity, but does not necessarily benefit downstream tasks. Our further analysis experiments unveil that calibration in the target language mainly contributes to preserving language-specific features related to fluency and coherence, but might not contribute to capturing language-agnostic features such as language understanding and reasoning. Last, we provide practical recommendations for future practitioners.|\n", "2408.14387": "|**2024-08-26**|**Reprogramming Foundational Large Language Models(LLMs) for Enterprise Adoption for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Applications: Unveiling a New Era in Copilot-Guided Cross-Modal Time Series Representation Learning**|Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas et.al.|[2408.14387](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14387)|null|Spatio-temporal forecasting plays a crucial role in various sectors such as transportation systems, logistics, and supply chain management. However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.|\n", "2408.14380": "|**2024-08-26**|**Probing Causality Manipulation of Large Language Models**|Chenyang Zhang et.al.|[2408.14380](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14380)|**[link](https://github.com/tongjinlp/llm-causality-probing)**|**Large language models (LLMs) have shown various ability on natural language processing, including problems about causality.

So that probing internal manipulation of causality is necessary for LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to probe causality manipulation hierarchically, by providing different shortcuts to models and observe behaviors. We exploit retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models on a designed causality classification task. We conduct experiments on mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models.

We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues.

Traditional approaches relying on pre-trained models necessitate extensive domain-specific data and considerable reward feedback, with their lack of real-time adaptability hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework, leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster trustworthiness reasoning in agents. GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness graph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves relevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer game \"Werewolf,\" comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with Native RAG and Rerank RAG. Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the baseline methods by over 30\\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning performance. Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as identity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process more transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph.**|\n", "2408.12249": "|**2024-08-22**|**LLMs are not Zero-Shot Reasoners for Biomedical Information Extraction**|Aishik Nagar et.al.|[2408.12249](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12249)|null|Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration. To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.|\n", "2408.12060": "|**2024-08-22**|**Evidence-backed Fact Checking using RAG and Few-Shot In-Context Learning with LLMs**|Ronit Singhal et.al.|[2408.12060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12060)|null|Given the widespread dissemination of misinformation on social media, implementing fact-checking mechanisms for online claims is essential.

We utilize the Averitec dataset to assess the veracity of claims. In addition to veracity prediction, our system provides supporting evidence, which is extracted from the dataset. We develop a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant evidence sentences from a knowledge base, which are then inputted along with the claim into a large language model (LLM) for classification.

We exploit retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models on a designed causality classification task. We conduct experiments on mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models.

However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance of biomedically fine-tuned LLMs against their general-purpose counterparts on a variety of clinical tasks. We evaluated their performance on clinical case challenges from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and on several clinical tasks (e.g., information extraction, document summarization, and clinical coding). Using benchmarks specifically chosen to be likely outside the fine-tuning datasets of biomedical models, we found that biomedical LLMs mostly perform inferior to their general-purpose counterparts, especially on tasks not focused on medical knowledge. While larger models showed similar performance on case tasks (e.g., OpenBioLLM-70B: 66.4% vs. Llama-3-70B-Instruct: 65% on JAMA cases), smaller biomedical models showed more pronounced underperformance (e.g., OpenBioLLM-8B: 30% vs. Llama-3-8B-Instruct: 64.3% on NEJM cases). Similar trends were observed across the CLUE (Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark tasks, with general-purpose models often performing better on text generation, question answering, and coding tasks. Our results suggest that fine-tuning LLMs to biomedical data may not provide the expected benefits and may potentially lead to reduced performance, challenging prevailing assumptions about domain-specific adaptation of LLMs and highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks in healthcare AI.

In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance.

Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task. First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode. In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations. The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult. ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns. The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM. Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.

Assessing and enforcing process compliance with a policy is a manual and ad-hoc task. This paper introduces a new paradigm for access control called Intent-Based Access Control for Databases (IBAC-DB). In IBAC-DB, access control policies are expressed more precisely using a novel format, the natural language access control matrix (NLACM). Database access control primitives are synthesized automatically from these NLACMs. These primitives can be used to generate new DB configurations and/or evaluate existing ones. This paper presents a reference architecture for an IBAC-DB interface, an initial implementation for PostgreSQL (which we call LLM4AC), and initial benchmarks that evaluate the accuracy and scope of such a system. We further describe how to extend LLM4AC to handle other types of database deployment requirements, including temporal constraints and role hierarchies. We propose RHieSys, a requirement-specific method of extending LLM4AC, and DePLOI, a generalized method of extending LLM4AC.

Metaverse**|Yahao Ding et.al.|[2408.14416](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14416)|null|The Metaverse, a burgeoning collective virtual space merging augmented reality and persistent virtual worlds, necessitates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technologies to support immersive and interactive experiences. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for collaboratively training AI models while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges such as high communication overhead and substantial computational demands, particularly for neural network (NN) models. To address these issues, we propose an integrated federated split learning and hyperdimensional computing (FSL-HDC) framework for emerging foundation models. This novel approach reduces communication costs, computation load, and privacy risks, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices in the Metaverse, ensuring real-time responsive interactions. Additionally, we introduce an optimization algorithm that concurrently optimizes transmission power and bandwidth to minimize the maximum transmission time among all users to the server. The simulation results based on the MNIST dataset indicate that FSL-HDC achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 87.5%, which is slightly lower than that of FL-HDC. However, FSL-HDC exhibits a significantly faster convergence speed, approximately 3.733x that of FSL-NN, and demonstrates robustness to non-IID data distributions. Moreover, our proposed optimization algorithm can reduce the maximum transmission time by up to 64% compared with the baseline.|\n", "2408.14298": "|**2024-08-26**|**Resource Efficient Asynchronous Federated Learning for Digital Twin Empowered IoT Network**|Shunfeng Chu et.al.|[2408.14298](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14298)|null|As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) can provide real-time status and dynamic topology mapping for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, DT and its implementation within industrial IoT networks necessitates substantial, distributed data support, which often leads to ``data silos'' and raises privacy concerns. To address these issues, we develop a dynamic resource scheduling algorithm tailored for the asynchronous federated learning (FL)-based lightweight DT empowered IoT network. Specifically, our approach aims to minimize a multi-objective function that encompasses both energy consumption and latency by optimizing IoT device selection and transmit power control, subject to FL model performance constraints. We utilize the Lyapunov method to decouple the formulated problem into a series of one-slot optimization problems and develop a two-stage optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal transmission power control and IoT device scheduling strategies. In the first stage, we derive closed-form solutions for optimal transmit power on the IoT device side. In the second stage, since partial state information is unknown, e.g., the transmitting power and computational frequency of IoT device, the edge server employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to model the IoT device selection problem and utilizes an efficient online algorithm, namely the client utility-based upper confidence bound (CU-UCB), to address it. Numerical results validate our algorithm's superiority over benchmark schemes, and simulations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves faster training speeds on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets within the same training duration.|\n", "2408.14240": "|**2024-08-26**|**Celtibero: Robust Layered Aggregation for Federated Learning**|Borja Molina-Coronado et.al.|[2408.14240](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14240)|null|Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative approach to distributed machine learning. While FL offers significant privacy advantages, it also faces security challenges, particularly from poisoning attacks where adversaries deliberately manipulate local model updates to degrade model performance or introduce hidden backdoors. Existing defenses against these attacks have been shown to be effective when the data on the nodes is identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.), but they often fail under less restrictive, non-i.i.d data conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Celtibero, a novel defense mechanism that integrates layered aggregation to enhance robustness against adversarial manipulation. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and IMDB datasets, we demonstrate that Celtibero consistently achieves high main task accuracy (MTA) while maintaining minimal attack success rates (ASR) across a range of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks. Our results highlight the superiority of Celtibero over existing defenses such as FL-Defender, LFighter, and FLAME, establishing it as a highly effective solution for securing federated learning systems against sophisticated poisoning attacks.|\n", "2408.14144": "|**2024-08-26**|**Neighborhood and Global Perturbations Supported SAM in Federated Learning: From Local Tweaks To Global Awareness**|Boyuan Li et.al.|[2408.14144](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14144)|null|Federated Learning (FL) can be coordinated under the orchestration of a central server to collaboratively build a privacy-preserving model without the need for data exchange. However, participant data heterogeneity leads to local optima divergence, subsequently affecting convergence outcomes. Recent research has focused on global sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and dynamic regularization techniques to enhance consistency between global and local generalization and optimization objectives. Nonetheless, the estimation of global SAM introduces additional computational and memory overhead, while dynamic regularization suffers from bias in the local and global dual variables due to training isolation. In this paper, we propose a novel FL algorithm, FedTOGA, designed to consider optimization and generalization objectives while maintaining minimal uplink communication overhead. By linking local perturbations to global updates, global generalization consistency is improved. Additionally, global updates are used to correct local dynamic regularizers, reducing dual variables bias and enhancing optimization consistency. Global updates are passively received by clients, reducing overhead. We also propose neighborhood perturbation to approximate local perturbation, analyzing its strengths and limitations. Theoretical analysis shows FedTOGA achieves faster convergence $O(1/T)$ under non-convex functions. Empirical studies demonstrate that FedTOGA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 1\\% accuracy increase and 30\\% faster convergence, achieving state-of-the-art.|\n", "2408.14001": "|**2024-08-26**|**Decentralized Federated Learning with Model Caching on Mobile Agents**|Xiaoyu Wang et.al.|[2408.14001](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14001)|null|Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a shared model using data and computation power on distributed agents coordinated by a central server. Decentralized FL (DFL) utilizes local model exchange and aggregation between agents to reduce the communication and computation overheads on the central server. However, when agents are mobile, the communication opportunity between agents can be sporadic, largely hindering the convergence and accuracy of DFL. In this paper, we study delay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on mobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of agents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange their own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation works on all models in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of DFL with cached models, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by caching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different DFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular network to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility, cache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, cached DFL converges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.|\n", "2408.13926": "|**2024-08-25**|**FedGlu: A personalized federated learning-based glucose forecasting algorithm for improved performance in glycemic excursion regions**|Darpit Dave et.al.|[2408.13926](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13926)|null|Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices provide real-time glucose monitoring and timely alerts for glycemic excursions, improving glycemic control among patients with diabetes. However, identifying rare events like hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia remain challenging due to their infrequency. Moreover, limited access to sensitive patient data hampers the development of robust machine learning models. Our objective is to accurately predict glycemic excursions while addressing data privacy concerns. To tackle excursion prediction, we propose a novel Hypo-Hyper (HH) loss function, which significantly improves performance in the glycemic excursion regions. The HH loss function demonstrates a 46% improvement over mean-squared error (MSE) loss across 125 patients. To address privacy concerns, we propose FedGlu, a machine learning model trained in a federated learning (FL) framework. FL allows collaborative learning without sharing sensitive data by training models locally and sharing only model parameters across other patients. FedGlu achieves a 35% superior glycemic excursion detection rate compared to local models. This improvement translates to enhanced performance in predicting both, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, for 105 out of 125 patients. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed HH loss function in augmenting the predictive capabilities of glucose predictions. Moreover, implementing models within a federated learning framework not only ensures better predictive capabilities but also safeguards sensitive data concurrently.|\n", "2408.13849": "|**2024-08-25**|**Sample-Independent Federated Learning Backdoor Attack**|Weida Xu et.al.|[2408.13849](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13849)|null|In federated learning, backdoor attacks embed triggers in the adversarial client's data to inject a backdoor into the model. To evade detection through sample analysis, non-sample-modifying backdoor attack methods based on dropout have been developed. However, these methods struggle to covertly utilize dropout in evaluation mode, thus hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address these, this paper introduces GhostB, a novel approach to federated learning backdoor attacks that neither alters samples nor relies on dropout. This method employs the behavior of neurons producing specific values as triggers. By mapping these neuronal values to categories specified by the adversary, the backdoor is implanted and activated when particular feature values are detected at designated neurons. Our experiments conducted on TIMIT, LibriSpeech, and VoxCeleb2 databases in both Closed Set Identification (CSI) and Open Set Identification (OSI) scenarios demonstrate that GhostB achieves a 100% success rate upon activation, with this rate maintained across experiments involving 1 to 50 ghost neurons. This paper investigates how the dispersion of neurons and their depth within hidden layers affect the success rate, revealing that increased dispersion and positioning of neurons can significantly decrease effectiveness, potentially rendering the attack unsuccessful.|\n", "2408.13773": "|**2024-08-25**|**SAB:A Stealing and Robust Backdoor Attack based on Steganographic Algorithm against Federated Learning**|Weida Xu et.al.|[2408.13773](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13773)|null|Federated learning, an innovative network architecture designed to safeguard user privacy, is gaining widespread adoption in the realm of technology. However, given the existence of backdoor attacks in federated learning, exploring the security of federated learning is significance. Nevertheless, the backdoors investigated in current federated learning research can be readily detected by human inspection or resisted by detection algorithms. Accordingly, a new goal has been set to develop stealing and robust federated learning backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, SAB, tailored specifically for backdoor attacks in federated learning, presenting an alternative gradient updating mechanism. SAB attack based on steganographic algorithm, using image steganographic algorithm to build a full-size trigger to improve the accuracy of backdoors and use multiple loss joint computation to produce triggers. SAB exhibits smaller distances to benign samples and greater imperceptibility to the human eye. As such, our triggers are capable of mitigating or evading specific backdoor defense methods. In SAB, the bottom-95\\% method is applied to extend the lifespan of backdoor attacks. It updates the gradient on minor value points to reduce the probability of being cleaned. Finally, the generalization of backdoors is enhanced with Sparse-update to improve the backdoor accuracy.|\n", "2408.13683": "|**2024-08-24**|**Submodular Maximization Approaches for Equitable Client Selection in Federated Learning**|Andr\u00e9s Catalino Castillo Jim\u00e9nez et.al.|[2408.13683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13683)|null|In a conventional Federated Learning framework, client selection for training typically involves the random sampling of a subset of clients in each iteration. However, this random selection often leads to disparate performance among clients, raising concerns regarding fairness, particularly in applications where equitable outcomes are crucial, such as in medical or financial machine learning tasks. This disparity typically becomes more pronounced with the advent of performance-centric client sampling techniques. This paper introduces two novel methods, namely SUBTRUNC and UNIONFL, designed to address the limitations of random client selection. Both approaches utilize submodular function maximization to achieve more balanced models. By modifying the facility location problem, they aim to mitigate the fairness concerns associated with random selection. SUBTRUNC leverages client loss information to diversify solutions, while UNIONFL relies on historical client selection data to ensure a more equitable performance of the final model. Moreover, these algorithms are accompanied by robust theoretical guarantees regarding convergence under reasonable assumptions. The efficacy of these methods is demonstrated through extensive evaluations across heterogeneous scenarios, revealing significant improvements in fairness as measured by a client dissimilarity metric.|\n", "2408.13626": "|**2024-08-24**|**Towards Case-based Interpretability for Medical Federated Learning**|Laura Latorre et.al.|[2408.13626](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13626)|null|We explore deep generative models to generate case-based explanations in a medical federated learning setting.
