Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges.

Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.|\n", "2409.08963": "|**2024-09-13**|**Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating Community Rule Compliance**|Lucio La Cava et.al.|[2409.08963](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08963)|null|\n", "2409.08717": "|**2024-09-13**|**Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with LLM-based Agents**|Junchi Yao et.al.|[2409.08717](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08717)|null|\n", "2409.10372": "|**2024-09-16**|**Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information Modulation**|Qiliang Chen et.al.|[2409.10372](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372)|null|This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.

This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs.

However, current search algorithms in this domain suffer from low search quality due to several reasons: 1) Ineffective design of the search space for the high-reasoning demands of code generation tasks, 2) Inadequate integration of code feedback with the search algorithm, and 3) Poor handling of negative feedback during the search, leading to reduced search efficiency and quality. To address these challenges, we propose to search for the reasoning process of the code and use the detailed feedback of code execution to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. In this paper, we introduce RethinkMCTS, which employs the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to conduct thought-level searches before generating code, thereby exploring a wider range of strategies. More importantly, we construct verbal feedback from fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. This ensures that the search progresses along the correct reasoning paths, thus improving the overall search quality of the tree by leveraging execution feedback. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-based code generation baselines. On the HumanEval dataset, it improves the pass@1 of GPT-3.5-turbo from 70.12 to 89.02 and GPT-4o-mini from 87.20 to 94.51.

However, LLM agents still face challenges in tasks that require multiple decision-making steps. Estimating the value of actions in specific tasks is difficult when intermediate actions are neither appropriately rewarded nor penalized. In this paper, we propose leveraging a task-relevant Q-value model to guide action selection. Specifically, we first collect decision-making trajectories annotated with step-level Q values via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and construct preference data. We then use another LLM to fit these preferences through step-level Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which serves as the Q-value model. During inference, at each decision-making step, LLM agents select the action with the highest Q value before interacting with the environment. We apply our method to various open-source and API-based LLM agents, demonstrating that Q-value models significantly improve their performance. Notably, the performance of the agent built with Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct improved by 103% on WebShop and 75% on HotPotQA when enhanced with Q-value models, even surpassing GPT-4o-mini. Additionally, Q-value models offer several advantages, such as generalization to different LLM agents and seamless integration with existing prompting strategies.|\n", "2409.09271": "|**2024-09-14**|**Python Symbolic Execution with LLM-powered Code Generation**|Wenhan Wang et.al.|[2409.09271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09271)|null|Symbolic execution is a key technology in software testing, which generates test cases by collecting symbolic path constraints and then solving constraints with SMT solvers. Symbolic execution has been proven helpful in generating high-coverage test cases, but its limitations, e.g., the difficulties in solving path constraints, prevent it from broader usage in software testing. Moreover, symbolic execution has encountered many difficulties when applied to dynamically typed languages like Python, because it is extremely challenging to translate the flexible Python grammar into rigid solvers.   To overcome the main challenges of applying symbolic execution in Python, we proposed an LLM-empowered agent, LLM-Sym, that automatically calls an SMT solver, Z3, to solve execution path constraints. Based on an introductory-level symbolic execution engine, our LLM agent can extend it to supporting programs with complex data type `list'. The core contribution of LLM-Sym is translating complex Python path constraints into Z3 code. To enable accurate path-to-Z3 translation, we design a multiple-step code generation pipeline including type inference, retrieval and self-refine. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Sym is capable of solving path constraints on Leetcode problems with complicated control flows and list data structures, which is impossible for the backbone symbolic execution engine. Our approach paves the way for the combination of the generation ability of LLMs with the reasoning ability of symbolic solvers, and opens up new opportunities in LLM-augmented test case generation.|\n", "2409.11393": "|**2024-09-17**|**LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents**|Amine B.

However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity. Indeed, they focused mainly on functionalities and overlooked the definition of the component's boundaries within the agent. This caused terminological and architectural ambiguities between researchers which we addressed in this paper by proposing a unified framework that establishes a clear foundation for LLM-based agents' development from both functional and software architectural perspectives.   Our framework, LLM-Agent-UMF (LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework), clearly distinguishes between the different components of an agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a newly introduced element: the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent which comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security, the latter often neglected in previous works. Differences in the internal structure of core-agents led us to classify them into a taxonomy of passive and active types. Based on this, we proposed different multi-core agent architectures combining unique characteristics of various individual agents.   For evaluation purposes, we applied this framework to a selection of state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assessed four of our proposed architectures by integrating distinctive agents into hybrid active/passive core-agents' systems.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to enhance ABMs by using LLMs as agents with further potential to capture adaptive behavior. However, the computational infeasibility of using LLMs for large populations has hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we introduce AgentTorch -- a framework that scales ABMs to millions of agents while capturing high-resolution agent behavior using LLMs. We benchmark the utility of LLMs as ABM agents, exploring the trade-off between simulation scale and individual agency. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate how AgentTorch can simulate 8.4 million agents representing New York City, capturing the impact of isolation and employment behavior on health and economic outcomes. We compare the performance of different agent architectures based on heuristic and LLM agents in predicting disease waves and unemployment rates. Furthermore, we showcase AgentTorch's capabilities for retrospective, counterfactual, and prospective analyses, highlighting how adaptive agent behavior can help overcome the limitations of historical data in policy design.

But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.|\n", "2409.12180": "|**2024-09-18**|**Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty**|Arslan Chaudhry et.al.|[2409.12180](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180)|null|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result, end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim answers.|\n", "2409.12150": "|**2024-09-18**|**Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit Recommendation with Preference**|Najmeh Forouzandehmehr et.al.|[2409.12150](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150)|null|Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit generation.|\n", "2409.12147": "|**2024-09-18**|**MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning**|Justin Chih-Yao Chen et.al.|[2409.12147](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147)|**[link](https://github.com/dinobby/magicore)**|**Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores. Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5 and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by 4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent communication.**|\n", "2409.12140": "|**2024-09-18**|**MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion**|Kalakonda Sai Shashank et.al.|[2409.12140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12140)|null|We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions. Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving the performance of motion diffusion models.

We demonstrate that our novel codec can make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous models.|\n", "2409.12106": "|**2024-09-18**|**Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with Large Language Models**|Haoran Ye et.al.|[2409.12106](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106)|**[link](https://github.com/value4ai/gpv)**|**Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline. Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity, and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety. Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.**|\n", "2409.12046": "|**2024-09-18**|**Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and Figures**|Yumeng Yang et.al.|[2409.12046](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046)|null|Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a time-consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions, showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to generate specific predefined TFLs.|\n", "2409.12010": "|**2024-09-18**|**ChefFusion: Multimodal Foundation Model Integrating Recipe and Food Image Generation**|Peiyu Li et.al.|[2409.12010](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12010)|**[link](https://github.com/peiyu-georgia-li/cheffusion-multimodal-foundation-model-integrating-recipe-and-food-image-generation)**|**Significant work has been conducted in the domain of food computing, yet these studies typically focus on single tasks such as t2t (instruction generation from food titles and ingredients), i2t (recipe generation from food images), or t2i (food image generation from recipes). None of these approaches integrate all modalities simultaneously. To address this gap, we introduce a novel food computing foundation model that achieves true multimodality, encompassing tasks such as t2t, t2i, i2t, it2t, and t2ti. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, our model can perform a diverse array of food computing-related tasks, including food understanding, food recognition, recipe generation, and food image generation. Compared to previous models, our foundation model demonstrates a significantly broader range of capabilities and exhibits superior performance, particularly in food image generation and recipe generation tasks.

Interestingly, these can be integrated into material embeddings, potentially useful for data-driven predictions of materials properties. We investigate the extent to which LLM-derived vectors capture the desired information and their potential to provide insights into material properties without additional training. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs can be used to generate representations reflecting certain property information, extracting the embeddings requires identifying the optimal contextual clues and appropriate comparators. Despite this restriction, it appears that LLMs still have the potential to be useful in generating meaningful materials-science representations.|\n"}, "Wireless Network": {"2408.07702": "|**2024-08-14**|**The Death of Schema Linking?

While much of the current research in this field focuses on performance optimization, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency, the trustworthiness of RAG systems remains an area still under exploration. From a positive perspective, RAG systems are promising to enhance LLMs by providing them with useful and up-to-date knowledge from vast external databases, thereby mitigating the long-standing problem of hallucination. While from a negative perspective, RAG systems are at the risk of generating undesirable contents if the retrieved information is either inappropriate or poorly utilized. To address these concerns, we propose a unified framework that assesses the trustworthiness of RAG systems across six key dimensions: factuality, robustness, fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. Within this framework, we thoroughly review the existing literature on each dimension. Additionally, we create the evaluation benchmark regarding the six dimensions and conduct comprehensive evaluations for a variety of proprietary and open-source models. Finally, we identify the potential challenges for future research based on our investigation results.

Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL.

Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.|\n", "2409.11242": "|**2024-09-17**|**Measuring and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in RAG through Grounded Attributions and Learning to Refuse**|Maojia Song et.al.|[2409.11242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11242)|**[link](https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align)**|**LLMs are an integral part of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

Key focus areas include a retry mechanism with error output traceback, comprehensive code rewriting and replacement using Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) parsing to minimize linting issues, code embedding technique for retrieval-augmented generation, and a focus on localizing methods for problem-solving rather than identifying specific line numbers. The methodology employs a three-step hierarchical search space reduction approach for code base navigation and bug localization:utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Repository File Level Map to identify candidate files, (2) narrowing down to the most relevant files using a File Level Schematic Map, and (3) extracting 'relevant locations' within these files. Code editing is performed through a two-part module comprising CodeGeneration and CodeEditing, which generates multiple solutions at different temperature values and replaces entire methods or classes to maintain code integrity. A feedback loop executes repository-level test cases to validate and refine solutions. Experiments conducted on the SWE-bench Lite dataset demonstrate SuperCoder2.0's effectiveness, achieving correct file localization in 84.33% of cases within the top 5 candidates and successfully resolving 34% of test instances. This performance places SuperCoder2.0 fourth globally on the SWE-bench leaderboard.

In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different styles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with popular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details.|\n", "2409.10576": "|**2024-09-18**|**Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Structured Data Extraction from Diagnostic Reports**|Mohamed Sobhi Jabal et.al.|[2409.10576](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10576)|null|\n", "2409.12140": "|**2024-09-18**|**MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion**|Kalakonda Sai Shashank et.al.|[2409.12140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12140)|null|We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented generation strategy for text-based human motion generation.

This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness.

This study introduces SageCopilot, an advanced, industry-grade system system that automates the data science pipeline by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Autonomous Agents (AutoAgents), and Language User Interfaces (LUIs). Specifically, SageCopilot incorporates a two-phase design: an online component refining users' inputs into executable scripts through In-Context Learning (ICL) and running the scripts for results reporting & visualization, and an offline preparing demonstrations requested by ICL in the online phase. A list of trending strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and prompt-tuning have been used to augment SageCopilot for enhanced performance. Through rigorous testing and comparative analysis against prompt-based solutions, SageCopilot has been empirically validated to achieve superior end-to-end performance in generating or executing scripts and offering results with visualization, backed by real-world datasets.

While prior works often adapted off-the-shelf encoders to retrieve examples dynamically, an inherent discrepancy exists in the representational capacities between the external retrievers and the LLMs. Further, optimizing the selection of examples is a non-trivial task, since there are no straightforward methods to assess the relative benefits of examples without performing pairwise inference. To address these shortcomings, we propose DeTriever, a novel demonstration retrieval framework that learns a weighted combination of LLM hidden states, where rich semantic information is encoded. To train the model, we propose a proxy score that estimates the relative benefits of examples based on the similarities between output queries.

To address the posed questions, we present a multi-angle NL2SQL evaluation framework, NL2SQL360, to facilitate the design and test of new NL2SQL methods for researchers.

Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task. First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode. In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations. The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult. ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns. The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM. Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.|\n", "2403.20014": "|**2024-03-29**|**PURPLE: Making a Large Language Model a Better SQL Writer**|Tonghui Ren et.al.|[2403.20014](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20014)|null|Large Language Model (LLM) techniques play an increasingly important role in Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation. LLMs trained by extensive corpora have strong natural language understanding and basic SQL generation abilities without additional tuning specific to NL2SQL tasks. Existing LLMs-based NL2SQL approaches try to improve the translation by enhancing the LLMs with an emphasis on user intention understanding. However, LLMs sometimes fail to generate appropriate SQL due to their lack of knowledge in organizing complex logical operator composition. A promising method is to input the LLMs with demonstrations, which include known NL2SQL translations from various databases. LLMs can learn to organize operator compositions from the input demonstrations for the given task. In this paper, we propose PURPLE (Pre-trained models Utilized to Retrieve Prompts for Logical Enhancement), which improves accuracy by retrieving demonstrations containing the requisite logical operator composition for the NL2SQL task on hand, thereby guiding LLMs to produce better SQL translation. PURPLE achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 80.5% exact-set match accuracy and 87.8% execution match accuracy on the validation set of the popular NL2SQL benchmark Spider.

We first introduce a novel prompt representation, called reference-enhanced representation, which includes schema information and randomly sampled cell values from tables to instruct LLMs in generating SQL queries. Then, in the first stage, question-SQL pairs are retrieved as few-shot demonstrations, prompting the LLM to generate a preliminary SQL (PreSQL). After that, the mentioned entities in PreSQL are parsed to conduct schema linking, which can significantly compact the useful information. In the second stage, with the linked schema, we simplify the prompt's schema information and instruct the LLM to produce the final SQL.

Some approaches have sought to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to address analogous tasks like text2SQL. Nonetheless, in the realm of NL2GQL tasks tailored to a particular domain, the absence of domain-specific NL-GQL data pairs adds complexity to aligning LLMs with the graph DB. To tackle this challenge, we present a well-defined pipeline. Initially, we utilize ChatGPT to generate NL-GQL data pairs, leveraging the provided graph DB with self-instruction. Subsequently, we employ the generated data to fine-tune LLMs, ensuring alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. Moreover, we find the importance of relevant schema in efficiently generating accurate GQLs. Thus, we introduce a method to extract relevant schema as the input context. We evaluate our method using two carefully constructed datasets derived from graph DBs in the finance and medicine domains, named FinGQL and MediGQL.

terms of new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way, clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.|\n", "2409.09794": "|**2024-09-15**|**Federated Learning in Adversarial Environments: Testbed Design and Poisoning Resilience in Cybersecurity**|Hao Jian Huang et.al.|[2409.09794](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09794)|null|This paper presents the design and implementation of a Federated Learning (FL) testbed, focusing on its application in cybersecurity and evaluating its resilience against poisoning attacks.

Through a case study on federated intrusion detection systems, we demonstrate the testbed's capabilities in detecting anomalies and securing critical infrastructure without exposing sensitive network data. Comprehensive poisoning tests, targeting both model and data integrity, evaluate the system's robustness under adversarial conditions.

Currently, FL-ISCC primarily includes two algorithms: FedAVG-ISCC and FedSGD-ISCC. However, the theoretical understanding of the performance and advantages of these algorithms remains limited. To address this gap, we investigate a general FL-ISCC framework, implementing both FedAVG-ISCC and FedSGD-ISCC. We experimentally demonstrate the substantial potential of the ISCC framework in reducing latency and energy consumption in FL. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis and comparison. The results reveal that:1) Both sample collection and communication errors negatively impact algorithm performance, highlighting the need for careful design to optimize FL-ISCC applications. 2) FedAVG-ISCC performs better than FedSGD-ISCC under IID data due to its advantage with multiple local updates. 3) FedSGD-ISCC is more robust than FedAVG-ISCC under non-IID data, where the multiple local updates in FedAVG-ISCC worsen performance as non-IID data increases. FedSGD-ISCC maintains performance levels similar to IID conditions. 4) FedSGD-ISCC is more resilient to communication errors than FedAVG-ISCC, which suffers from significant performance degradation as communication errors increase.Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the FL-ISCC framework and validate our theoretical analysis.|\n", "2409.10764": "|**2024-09-16**|**Federated Learning for Smart Grid: A Survey on Applications and Potential Vulnerabilities**|Zikai Zhang et.al.|[2409.10764](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10764)|null|The Smart Grid (SG) is a critical energy infrastructure that collects real-time electricity usage data to forecast future energy demands using information and communication technologies (ICT).

In this survey, we thoroughly review recent advancements in designing FL-based SG systems across three stages: generation, transmission and distribution, and consumption. Additionally, we explore potential vulnerabilities that may arise when implementing FL in these stages.

However, datasets distributed across each client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data. This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems, we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.**|\n", "2409.12020": "|**2024-09-18**|**Promise and Peril of Collaborative Code Generation Models: Balancing Effectiveness and Memorization**|Zhi Chen et.al.|[2409.12020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12020)|null|In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, training models with datasets from various locations and organizations presents significant challenges due to privacy and legal concerns. The exploration of effective collaborative training settings capable of leveraging valuable knowledge from distributed and isolated datasets is increasingly crucial. This study investigates key factors that impact the effectiveness of collaborative training methods in code next-token prediction, as well as the correctness and utility of the generated code, demonstrating the promise of such methods. Additionally, we evaluate the memorization of different participant training data across various collaborative training settings, including centralized, federated, and incremental training, highlighting their potential risks in leaking data. Our findings indicate that the size and diversity of code datasets are pivotal factors influencing the success of collaboratively trained code models. We show that federated learning achieves competitive performance compared to centralized training while offering better data protection, as evidenced by lower memorization ratios in the generated code. However, federated learning can still produce verbatim code snippets from hidden training data, potentially violating privacy or copyright. Our study further explores effectiveness and memorization patterns in incremental learning, emphasizing the sequence in which individual participant datasets are introduced. We also identify cross-organizational clones as a prevalent challenge in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the persistent risk of data leakage during inference, even when training data remains unseen.

Despite its broad applications in fields such as computer vision, graph learning, and natural language processing, the development of a data projection model that can be effectively used to visualize data in the context of FL is crucial yet remains heavily under-explored. Neighbor embedding (NE) is an essential technique for visualizing complex high-dimensional data, but collaboratively learning a joint NE model is difficult. The key challenge lies in the objective function, as effective visualization algorithms like NE require computing loss functions among pairs of data. In this paper, we introduce \\textsc{FedNE}, a novel approach that integrates the \\textsc{FedAvg} framework with the contrastive NE technique, without any requirements of shareable data. To address the lack of inter-client repulsion which is crucial for the alignment in the global embedding space, we develop a surrogate loss function that each client learns and shares with each other. Additionally, we propose a data-mixing strategy to augment the local data, aiming to relax the problems of invisible neighbors and false neighbors constructed by the local $k$NN graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

While this approach offers significant benefits such as privacy preservation and decreased communication overhead, it presents several challenges, including deployment complexity and interoperability issues, particularly in heterogeneous scenarios or resource-constrained environments. Over-the-air (OTA) FL was introduced to tackle these challenges by disseminating model updates without necessitating direct device-to-device connections or centralized servers. However, OTA-FL brought forth limitations associated with heightened energy consumption and network latency. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute client selection framework employing the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to strategically control the number of participants in each round and optimize the OTA-FL process while considering accuracy, energy, delay, reliability, and fairness constraints of participating devices. We evaluate the performance of our multi-attribute client selection approach in terms of model loss minimization, convergence time reduction, and energy efficiency. In our experimental evaluation, we assessed and compared the performance of our approach against the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GWO-based client selection outperforms these baselines across various metrics. Specifically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in model loss, accelerates convergence time, and enhances energy efficiency while maintaining high fairness and reliability indicators.|\n"}}
